            **Remember to:**

            1. Run the migrations in [stage database branch](https://app.planetscale.com/begursecret/descobreix-begur-app/stage) with:
               ```bash
               pnpm db:push
               ```
            1. Create a [deploy request in Planetscale](https://app.planetscale.com/begursecret/descobreix-begur-app/deploy-requests/)
            1. Merge the deploy request from Planetscale just before merging the PR.
